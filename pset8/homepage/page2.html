                South African-born Elon Musk is best known as the business magnate, investor, and inventor responsible for founding companies like SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and SolarCity, and for his futuristic (and currently only hypothetical) high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. But Musk makes this list because he is the designer of PayPal, the revolutionary online program through which users can pay bills, collect fees, manage purchases, and more. Though Musk has since passed along the main responsibilities of PayPal, he currently acts as the CEO and CTO, CEO, and Chairman of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and SolarCity respectively.

                <div class="subHeaderName">2. Sergey Brin</div>
                Sergey Brin is the co-founder of Google, one of the most profitable internet companies of all time. He is an American computer scientist who emigrated from the Soviet Union at age six. As a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, Brin and his friend, Larry Page, crammed a bunch of cheap computers into their dorm room and developed Brin’s data mining system. The mining system became so popular at Stanford, that the two eventually decided to drop out, rent a garage, and start Google. Since then, Brin’s personal wealth has been estimated at more than $32 million. The Economist has declared Brin an “Enlightened Man,” which is an appropriate title considering Google’s mission statement has always included the idea that “knowledge is always good, and certainly better than ignorance.”

                <div class="subHeaderName">1. Tim Berners-Lee</div>
                Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who has single-handedly changed the course of human history. In 1989, he proposed a new information management system. A mere eight months later, he received the first successful communication from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol via the internet. Since then, Berners-Lee’s initial proposal, the World Wide Web, has become a vital part of nearly every household, business, school, and government in the world. In 2012, he was honored as the official inventor of the internet at the Olympics Opening Ceremony in London. During the ceremony, he live-tweeted “This is for everyone,” words which were instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to chairs in the crowd. Berners-Lee is currently the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), through which he oversees the internet’s continued development.
