        <h2 class="subHeader">Paving the way for a more equitable world</h2>
        <p>
            Computer science can really help level the playing field in terms of inexpensive solutions. But Hugo also points out that it can be an equalizer in other ways. Though technology as an industry has an under representation of women and racial minorities, Hugo sees computer science as a tool for societal rebalance when it comes to gender identity, background, ethnicity and beyond. Code is code—and if you’ve created something genuinely useful, your background isn’t going to hold you back.“The App Store has the same requirements for all developers,” she points out. Hugo says it is a positive step for society that computers are blind to everything but the code.

        <h2 class="subHeader">Expanding communication</h2>
        <p>
            “The biggest contribution computer science has made is in the field of communication,” says Manonit Nand, teacher and system administrator at the Mayoor School. “Computer Science has made the whole world a very small place—available at your fingertips now.”Nand mentions social media, video calling and chatting apps—even the applications that allow you to share documents and photos with someone else long-distance. These capacities have completely revolutionized the workforce.

        <h2 class="subHeader">Predicting and avoiding catastrophes</h2>
        <p>
            Computer science is scaling—and scaling very fast for that matter, according to Nand. Applying computer science to prediction can have a huge impact on the world. “We are predicting human behavior; we are predicting climates, seasons, ocean currents, etc.” Nand says.With these tools, we can predict everything from an incoming tsunami to the outbreak pattern of a pathogen. In that way, some of the most life-saving work that happens in our world relies on computer scientists. Computer science is even in action when predicting the trajectory of dangerous comets near our planet.
